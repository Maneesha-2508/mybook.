      <h1>PYCHO CYBERNETICS</h1>
      <p>by <b>Maxwell Malts,MD,FICS</B></br></p>
      <h1>some main points</h1>
      <p>1.your built-in success machanism must have a goal or <b>"target".</b> This goal or target must be concevied of as "already in existance-now" either in actual or potential form. It operates by either (1) steering you to a goal already in existence or (2) "discovering" something already in existence.</br>
         2.The automatic machanism telelogical,that is,it opreates or must be oriented to "end results" goals.Do not be discouraged because the "means whereby" may not be apparent. It is the function of the automatic machanism to supply the means whereby when you supply the goals. Think in terms of the end result, and the means whereby will often take care of themselves.</br>
         3.Do not be afraid of making mistakes, or of temporary failures. All servo-machanism achieve a goal by nagitive feedback, or by going forward,making mistakes, and immediately correcting course.</br>
         4.Skill learning of any kind is accomplished by trial and error, mentally correcting aim after an error, until a "successful" motion,movement,or performance has been achieved. After that,further learning , and continued success,<b><i> is accomplished by forgetting the part errors, and remembering the successful response, so that it can be imitated.</b></i></p>
